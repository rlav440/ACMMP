Theory for improvements:

What this paper demonstrates:
Good reconstructions are enabled by two areas.
## Raw reconstruction ##
- Smartly using low resolution reconstructions; upsampling, and consistency conditions to propagate surfaces from areas.
- Using geometric consistency between views to constrain the priors.

## introduction of good defaults ##
- In many cases, good defaults are much easier to calculate.
- Probablistic integration of these priors: requiring strong signals to materially deviate from these beliefs.

What can potentially be done.

Fundamentally, I propose working on some kind of modelled probability volume.

In the case of a single ray: this probability volume presents a modelled cost prior.

## that is: we have
We can update this prior with the evidence from each ray intersection at increasing resolutions.

## at this stage, we have multiple potential sources of info:
# cost and derivative for local planes
    At the plane update stage, when other permutations are tried, this information can be captured
# planar priors over the object surface


What is the form of the probability distribution?
#probability of intersection, probability of normal.

# how does this integrate with the hierachichal approach?
# at every step,
 1. We sample the existing distribution over the object.
 2. We run a reconstruction starting from this sample, recovering the raw + triangulation
 3. We update the central distribution with this information.
 4. Optionally, we run a biased reconstruction over this plane. (does this tell us anything - )
#finally
 5. We run a final reconstruction at the maximum resolution, which enables the recovery of this eventual information.


This neatly achieves the unification of geometric consistency between views, and geometric unification of the mvs.

The outstanding question is how this probability space is modelled to a high enough resolution to enable reconstruction
at very very high resolutions.
# maybe there is an idea here to have a lower resolution internal probability mesh, then the final depth maps are
able to operate at a higher resolution than the underlying map.

What we see is that a few things are actually
